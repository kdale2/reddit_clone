Reddit clone built with Angular - following along with ng-book
Functionality:
-Submit articles
-Display list of articles & # of votes
-Upvote articles
-Downvote articles
-If role is set to "administrator", there is an option to press flag article button 
(note: when a new article is submitted, the default role is 'user' so flag button currently only displays for existing articles with role set to admin.)
